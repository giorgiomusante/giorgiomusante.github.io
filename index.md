# About me

I am a mathematical physicist with a particular interest in the rigorous mathematical formalization of Quantum Field Theory on curved spacetimes.
In my past research I mainly focused on the homotopical and higher categorical features of classical and quantum field theories, especially (higher) gauge theories, on globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds. Algebraic Quantum Field Theory and Factorization Algebra particularly caught my interest among all frameworks used to investigate quantum theories.

In May 2024, I completed my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Genoa (IT) under the supervision of Prof. Marco Benini.

Before, I graduated in Physics at the University of Pavia (IT) under the supervision of Prof. Claudio Dappiaggi.

# Others

- My PhD Thesis "[Green hyperbolic complexes on Lorentzian manifolds and quantizations of gauge field theories](/pdfs/PhDThesis.pdf)" shares most of its content with [arXiv:2207.04069](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04069) and [arXiv:2212.02546](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02546), while dealing with preliminary and technical aspects in more detail.
- My Master's Thesis "[On the complex of observables for linearized gravity](/pdfs/linGravity.pdf)," was written under the supervision of Prof. Claudio Dappiaggi and the co-supervision of Prof. Marco Benini. It deals with a homotopical discussion of linearized gravity and its quantization as a *homotopy AQFT*.
